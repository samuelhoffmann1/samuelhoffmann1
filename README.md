# Hi, I’m Samuel Hoffmann 👋

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at Walla Walla University (graduating 2025) passionate about writing clean, maintainable code that solves real problems.

💻 I focus on backend development, APIs, and full-stack applications — with experience in mobile (Flutter), networking (Home Assistant), and system-level projects.

🌲 I'm especially interested in mission-driven tech that improves daily life. Think: coffee, outdoor gear, media, and tools people love to use.
