# Hi, I’m Samuel Hoffmann 👋

I'm a CS grad who likes to build practical stuff, mostly backend, APIs, and some full-stack projects. I’ve done a lot with Dart & Flutter, some firebase and networking, and I’m always looking to learn more, especially about system-level development.

I like working on projects that make a difference, are practical tools, or simply involve things I'm passionate about — coffee, backpacking, building relationships. Looking to join a team where I can grow, learn, and ship good code.

## 🚀 Projects

### 🧋 [Atlas Coffee Shop App](https://atlas.cs.wallawalla.edu)  
Student-run menu/announcement/rewards app for a campus coffee shop. Built with Flutter and Firebase. Includes SSO login, push notifications, and a reward system.

### 🧠 Language Interpreter Lab (F#)  
Built a working interpreter for a mini-language using F# and functional programming principles. This was one of the most challenging projects in my degree, it pushed me to understand parsing, evaluation, and language design from the ground up.

### 🏥 MAR Nursing Simulator  
Collaborative software project for Walla Walla University’s nursing department. I contributed to backend refactors, implemented RESTful APIs, and helped improve the maintainability of the codebase. (Project owned by the department — I was a contributing developer.)

### 🏡 Home IoT Hub  
Home automation system using a virtualized Home Assistant server. Features secure network segmentation (VLANs, firewalls) and remote control from PC/phone.

### 📊 Gradebook App (Hackathon 1st Place)  
Flutter-based web app for teachers to track grades. Integrated with a live API for real-time updates and secure login.

## 📁 About My Work

Most of my code over the last few years lives in private GitLab repos hosted by my university. I’m in the process of migrating selected projects to GitHub so I can share the things I’m proud of. What’s here now is just the start.
