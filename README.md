# Hi, I’m Samuel Hoffmann 👋

I'm a CS grad who likes to build practical stuff, mostly backend, APIs, and some full-stack projects. I’ve done a lot with Dart & Flutter, some firebase and networking, and I’m always looking to learn more, especially about system-level development.

I like working on projects that make a difference, are practical tools, or simply involve things I'm passionate about — coffee, backpacking, building relationships. Looking to join a team where I can grow, learn, and ship good code.
